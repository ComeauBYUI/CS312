    "## Course Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "CS 124 is the first class in a two class sequence exploring how to write code in C++. The first class, CS 124, teaches us how to write procedural programs. The second class, CS 165, teaches us how to write object oriented programs. The goal of CS 124 is that each student will be able to solve problems in C++ and have a solid foundation in software development methodology. By the end of the semester, each student will:\n",
    "\n",
    "Be well prepared for CS 165 and the other courses in the CS major\n",
    "Have confidence in their ability to solve problems with C++\n",
    "Possess a tool-bag of different approaches to solve software problems\n",
    "Have a firm foundation in the basic constructs of procedural C++\n",
    "These goals will be explored in the context of C++ using the Linux operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "This class will be divided into four units, each of which working the same way. After all the activities in a section are completed, you will have the opportunity to take the section test and complete the project. The four units are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simple Programs. How to get a C++ program to run on a Linux system and basic input/output. This includes branching mechanisms, functions, and expressions.\n",
    "* Design & Loops. The goal of this section is to be able to solve problems using loops and to learn how to tackle large and complex problems.\n",
    "* Pointers & Arrays. Next we will learn how to handle and manipulate large amounts of data in increasingly complex data structures. Specifically, we will learn about arrays and file I/O.\n",
    "* Advanced Topics. The final section is designed to reinforce the core skills learned in earlier sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Class Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Each unit will be sub-divided into seven or eight chapters / class-periods. We will work through one chapter per class period. Each class period (with certain exceptions) will follow the following pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preparation Assignment**: Must be completed before the exercises can be started. Most of these will include writing a simple C++ program. Please look at the end of each chapter in the text for the assignment. Once you have turned in the Preparation Assignment, you will be ready to work on the Exercise.\n",
    "2. **Questions & Answers**: When class begins, we will spend about half an hour answering any questions you may have on the current chapter, previous chapter, the preparation assignment, or any other aspect of programming.\n",
    "3. **Problems**: The remainder of the class will be spent working through problems designed to extend your understanding of the topic. Some of these problems will be tricky, the common pitfalls new programmers encounter while programming in C++. Some will require a bit of creativity. Each problem is presented in the end of the chapter.\n",
    "4. **Next Class**: The final 5 minutes of class will be spent giving you a peek at what we can expect for the next assignment and class period.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five components to your overall grade:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Item          | % of grade  |  Description  |\n",
    "|:--------------|:------------|:--------------|\n",
    "| Preparation Assignment      | 20% |  Work on the assignment as you read the text for the lesson. There will almost always be an example \"a lot like\" the assignment for each lesson. If you complete an assignment before class, you will get 100%. If you complete it two days early, you will get 150%. Any assignments that are late are given 50%.  You will have up until the end of the course to hand in any late assignments.  I-Learn doesn't allow me to set different due time for the different sections of this semester.  So ignore the due time for each assignment - they are due before your class time of your section.  |\n",
    "| Unit Tests      | 20%      |    4 tests worth 5% each. These will be problem-solving exercises on how to write code. Practice problems will be available.  |\n",
    "| Unit Projects | 40%      |     4 projects worth 10% each. These will be problem-solving exercises using the tools learned in the assignments. Projects will be due Saturdays are 11pm.  There is no late policy - hand in what you have working when the project is due.  |\n",
    "| Final Exam  | 20%  | Closed book multiple choice primarily on how to read code. The midterm will be in the testing center. The final exam will be in two parts on the last two days of class. Practice problems will be available. |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grades are as follows**\n",
    "\n",
    "|  Grade     |  Letter Grade |\n",
    "|:-----------|:--------------------|\n",
    "|100% → 90%\t  | A: Demonstrated mastery of the class |\n",
    "|89.9% → 80% |\t B: All of the key concepts and skills have been learned |\n",
    "|79.9% → 70% |\t C: Acceptable, but might not be ready or CS 165 |\n",
    "|69.9% → 60% |\t D: Developing; the class has yet to be mastered |\n",
    "|59.9% → 0%\t| F: Failed to understand or complete the course |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a minus (-) will be added when the last digit is a 0, 1, or 2 for all grades except F's. A plus (+) will be added when the last digit is a 7, 8, or 9 for all grades except A's and F's. Grades will be posted on I-Learn but you are responsible for verifying your grade. Please notify me if there is a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Materials\n",
    "\n",
    "The text for this semester will be James Helfrich's C++ Procedural Programming in C++. This will be available in the book store. You can also access the [textbook online](https://content.byui.edu/file/66227afd-b800-4ba3-b6b3-18db4db6c440/1/Procedural%20Programming%20in%20C%2B%2B.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "There will be additional material available through I-Learn, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Syllabus\n",
    "- Schedule\n",
    "- Additional references\n",
    "- Videos demonstrating many of the concepts discussed in the text\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there will be additional material available on the course Linux directory \\home\\cs124\n",
    "\n",
    "## Policies\n",
    "\n",
    "All communication (note passing, talking, and electronic) needs to be focused on the subject matter.  Make sure that you indicate your full name, the course and your section.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may work with your classmates but all submitted work must be original. Share ideas; do not share code! Assistance from a classmate should be on par with the help you would expect from a lab assistant. The penalty for copying or plagiarism of assignments might be one or more of the following: -100% on an assignment, being asked to withdraw from the class, a failing grade in the class, or disciplinary action by the University.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessibility\n",
