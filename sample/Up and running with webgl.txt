Up and running with webgl

These are the steps that I used to get my webgl demo running

1) Download MAMP to run a local server on your computer
  - You will be able to set the folder that will be the "localhost" directory

2) Download the code from github

3) I use Chrome.  I had to install the extension CORS to allow chrome
   to load the models into my webpage.  These models are from clara.io.
   I found that I might need to "reset" CORS after I load my webgl webpage
   (ie., load the html page, then click on the CORS button in Chrome)

4) clara.io models need to be downloaded for threejs.  Here is a link for
   information on how to load a model

   https://clara.io/learn/user-guide/data_exchange/threejs_export

5) use Chrome's developer tools to help you understand any issues you have.
